## 📌 About the Project

**MiniX: The Little Warriors** is a single-player 2D action-adventure game featuring Commander X, who must defend Rivertown from invading enemies across diverse biomes—**grasslands**, **deserts**, and **snow regions**. With strategic combat, environmental hazards, and narrative-driven gameplay, MiniX blends engaging mechanics with indie game aesthetics.

Built using **Godot 4** and **GDScript**, it showcases:

- Physics-based character control via `CharacterBody2D`
- Procedural scene structure for level design
- Sprite-based animations and interactive combat
- Modular biome-based progression and boss fights

📝 **Academic Publication:**  
This project is officially published in the *International Journal of Engineering and Advanced Science Technology (IJEAST)*. The paper provides a detailed overview of the game’s architecture, development methodology, and impact.
